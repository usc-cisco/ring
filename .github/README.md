## Joining the Webring

1. Fork this repo and add your information to the **BOTTOM** of `webring[]` in `/src/data/webring.ts` following this format:
   ```ts
   {
     name: "Your Name", // your full name
     year: "20XX", // your (year | expected year) of graduation 
     url: "https://your-website.com", // your personal website
   }
   ```
2. Submit a Pull Request using your fork & wait patiently for maintainer approval.

### Website Guidelines

1. Your URL must link to a personal website, hosted by you.
2. Your URL must contain content or information of you.
3. Your URL must not redirect to a product or non-personal website.

If your website does not comply with any of the guidelines above for 14 days, we reserve the right to remove it without prior notice.

Likewise, the maintainers reserve the right to take down entries that are deemed to be counter-productive or harmful to the goal of this webring.

## Q&A

#### _I'm not in DCISM. Can I still join?_

> Thank you for your interest! However, this webring is strictly for DCISM (Information Technology, Computer Science, Information Systems, Mathematics) students.
>
> If none of these are a fit, you can make your own! Webrings are a fantastic way to find new people, and don't take much technical skill to create.

#### _Do you accept alumni and post-grad students?_

> Yep, as long as you studied in any of the courses offered by DCISM. Just indicate your graduated year in the webring file.

#### _Can I change my details (name, year, URL) later?_

> Yes! What you can't change, however, is your position in the `webring[]` array. We'll consider randomizing the positions so that this won't be an issue in the future (when more people join). At the moment, please respect the early birds.

## Credits & Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from the [the University of Waterloo Computer Science Webring](https://github.com/JusGu/uwatering).

We'd also like to thank DCISM for allowing students to host websites on their servers.
